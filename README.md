## 📌 Project Overview

**AGRISENSE APP** is a UX case study focused on designing a **Smart Agriculture IoT mobile application** that helps farmers monitor field conditions, automate irrigation, and make data-driven decisions using AI-powered insights.

The primary goal of this project is to convert **complex IoT sensor data** into **simple, visual, and actionable information** that rural farmers can easily understand and trust.

This project was created as part of the academic subject **MDM – Introduction to UI/UX**.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Provide **real-time visibility** of farm field conditions  
- Help farmers take **timely irrigation decisions**
- Reduce water wastage through **smart automation**
- Deliver **AI-based insights** instead of raw sensor numbers
- Design a **simple, intuitive, and multilingual UI**

---

## 👥 Stakeholder Mapping

| Stakeholder        | Role                          | Needs |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|-------|
| Farmers (Primary)  | Daily decision-makers         | Simple UI, alerts, local language |
| Field Supervisors  | Manage multiple farms         | Analytics, comparisons |
| Agri Companies     | Provide sensors & services    | Data accuracy, automation |
| Developers         | Build IoT integration         | Clear user flows |
| Government / NGOs  | Promote smart farming         | Reliable & transparent insights |

---

## 🔍 UX Research & User Insights

### Research Methods
- In-person interviews  
- WhatsApp voice calls  

### Key Findings
- Farmers prefer **large visuals over complex graphs**
- **Color-coded alerts** are easier to understand
- **Language support (Hindi / Marathi)** is very important
- Farmers do not trust raw numbers unless the **app explains what action to take**

### User Quotes
> “Numbers are confusing… tell me what to do.”  
> “If moisture is low, the app should warn me early.”  
> “Graphs should be simple.”

## 👤 User Personas

### Persona 1: Farmer
- Age: 28  
- Location: Rural Maharashtra  
- Goals:
  - Monitor moisture & temperature easily
  - Reduce water wastage
  - Detect pest risks early
  - Use app in local language
- Frustrations:
  - Complex agricultural apps
  - Hard-to-read graphs
  - No clear actions suggested

### Persona 2: Field Supervisor
- Age: 27  
- Goals:
  - Monitor multiple fields
  - Track sensor health & connectivity
  - Generate reports
- Frustrations:
  - Switching between apps
  - No comparison between fields
  - No history of actions taken

---

## 🧭 Customer Journey Mapping

Key stages analyzed:
- Awareness
- Monitoring
- Decision-making
- Action (irrigation)
- Review & analytics

Pain points such as **information overload**, **uncertain thresholds**, and **manual effort** were identified and mapped to UX opportunities.

---

## 🧠 Empathy Mapping

The empathy study revealed that farmers:
- **Say:** “I need to know when to irrigate.”
- **Think:** “Is my crop getting enough water?”
- **Feel:** Worried about crop loss, overwhelmed by data
- **Do:** Manually check fields or call workers

This helped shape a **reassuring, guidance-driven UX**.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Farmers struggle to interpret **raw IoT sensor values** (moisture, temperature, humidity, pH), which results in:

- Poor irrigation decisions  
- Delayed response to crop risks  
- Guess-based farming  
- Reduced yield and financial loss  

---

## 💡 UX Solution Overview

The AGRISENSE UX design provides:

### 1️⃣ Real-Time Sensor Data
- Moisture, temperature, humidity & pH
- **Color-coded sensor cards**

### 2️⃣ AI-Powered Insights
- Irrigation recommendations
- Pest risk probability
- Yield prediction

### 3️⃣ Smart Alerts
- Critical, warning & informational alerts
- Multilingual notifications

### 4️⃣ Automation Control
- IoT irrigation ON/OFF
- Auto mode & timer scheduling

### 5️⃣ Advanced Analytics
- Multi-field comparison
- Trend charts
- Exportable reports

---

## 🎨 Design Process

The project follows the **Design Thinking Framework**:

1. Empathize – Understand farmer pain points  
2. Define – Convert insights into clear problems  
3. Ideate – Explore features & interaction flows  
4. Prototype – Low → Mid → High fidelity designs  
5. Test – Evaluate usability and clarity  
6. Refine – Improve based on feedback  

---

## 🧩 Ideation & Affinity Mapping

Key UX themes identified:
- **Simplicity:** Large cards, fewer numbers
- **Automation:** Auto irrigation, smart alerts
- **AI Intelligence:** Predictions & recommendations
- **Localization:** Hindi / Marathi support
- **Control & Transparency:** Analytics & reports

---

## 📱 Prototypes (Designed in Figma)

High-fidelity UI prototypes include:
- Login & onboarding screens
- Dashboard with sensor cards
- AI insights screen
- Automation control panel
- Alerts & notifications
- Analytics & history view

📌 *This repository contains a UX case study, not a functional application.*

---

## ✅ UX Impact & Outcomes
